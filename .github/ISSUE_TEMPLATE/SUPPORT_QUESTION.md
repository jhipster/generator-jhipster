We primarily use GitHub as an issue tracker, if your issue is not a **bug** or **feature request** then sorry you are not in the right place :wink:.
**If you have a question** please use Stack Overflow, and tag the question with [jhipster](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jhipster). This will help the project to keep a clean issue tracker. Also, Stack Overflow will give your question a larger audience:

-   This will increase your chances to get an answer
-   Answers will be of higher quality, as there is a voting system
-   This will also help other users who might have the same issue, as questions are tagged and easily searchable
