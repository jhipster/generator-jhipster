This is not a **bug** or **feature request** and hence this is not the correct forum for this.
**If you have a question** please use Stack Overflow, and tag the question with [jhipster](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jhipster). This helps the project to keep the issue tracker clean. Also, Stack Overflow will give your question a larger audience:
  - This will increase your chances of getting an answer
  - Answers will be of better quality, as there is a voting system
  - This will also help other users who might have the same issue, as questions are tagged and easily searchable
