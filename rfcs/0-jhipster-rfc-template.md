# JHipster-RFC-0: My awesome feature

<!-- This is a RFC template based on the Rust RFC process but simplified: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/ -->

- Feature Name: (fill me in with a unique ident, `my_awesome_feature`)
- Start Date: (fill me in with today's date, YYYY-MM-DD)
- Issue: [jhipster/generator-jhipster#0000](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/0000)

## Summary

[summary]: #summary

One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation

[motivation]: #motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Guide-level explanation

[guide-level-explanation]: #guide-level-explanation

Explain the proposal as if it was already included in JHipster and you were teaching it to someone. That generally means:

- Introducing new named concepts.
- Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.

## Reference-level explanation

[reference-level-explanation]: #reference-level-explanation

This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

The section should return to the examples given in the previous section, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.

## Drawbacks

[drawbacks]: #drawbacks

Why should we _not_ do this?

## Rationale and alternatives

[rationale-and-alternatives]: #rationale-and-alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

## Prior art

[prior-art]: #prior-art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.

## Unresolved questions

[unresolved-questions]: #unresolved-questions

- What are the limits of the proposal and define what is out of scope for now.

## Future possibilities

[future-possibilities]: #future-possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would
be.

This is also a good place to "dump ideas", if they are out of scope for the
RFC you are writing but otherwise related.
