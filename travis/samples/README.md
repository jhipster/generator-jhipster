# Sample application generation

To generate test applications, either automatically by Travis or locally on the developer machine, a number of pre-defined configurations have been prepared.

## Local Travis Build

Please see `../build-samples.sh help`

## Remote Travis CI

You could see:
https://travis-ci.org/jhipster/generator-jhipster

## Application configurations

Those are described in `.yo-rc.json` files which is the descriptor file created by Yeoman to keep track of the choices selected while generating an application.

## Entity configurations

We also have a number of `Entity.json` files for testing different entity configurations. They are in folder .jhipster of a generated sample.
