## Development setup

You need NodeJS and yarn.

### Fork the react-jhipster project

Go to the [react-jhipster project](https://github.com/jhipster/react-jhipster) and click on the "fork" button. You can then clone your own fork of the project, and start working on it.

[Please read the Github forking documentation for more information](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)

### Build

Run `yarn install` to install all dependencies.

Make some changes, run `yarn run test` to run both tslint and karma tests.

Package the library with `yarn run build`.

### Set NPM to use the cloned project

In your cloned `react-jhipster` project, type `yarn link`.

This will do a symbolic link from the global `node_modules` version to point to this folder.

For testing, you will want to integrate your version of `react-jhipster` into an application generated by JHipster.

Go to your application folder, run `yarn link react-jhipster` so that the local version has a symbolic link to the development version of `react-jhipster`.

You should see your changes reflected in the application.
