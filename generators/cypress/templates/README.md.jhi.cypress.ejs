#### E2E tests

UI end-to-end tests are powered by [Cypress][]. They're located in [<%= cypressDir %>](<%= cypressDir %>)
and can be run by starting Spring Boot in one terminal (`<%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> run app:start`) and running the tests (`<%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> run e2e`) in a second one.

Before running Cypress tests, it's possible to specify user credentials by overriding the `CYPRESS_E2E_USERNAME` and `CYPRESS_E2E_PASSWORD` environment variables.

```
export CYPRESS_E2E_USERNAME="<your-username>"
export CYPRESS_E2E_PASSWORD="<your-password>"
```

See Cypress' documentation for setting OS [environment variables](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables#Setting) to learn more.

#### Lighthouse audits

You can execute automated [Lighthouse audits](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) with [cypress-audit](https://github.com/mfrachet/cypress-audit) by running `<%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> run e2e:cypress:audits`.
You should only run the audits when your application is packaged with the production profile.
The lighthouse report is created in `<%= cypressTemporaryDir %>lhreport.html`.

### E2E Webapp Code Coverage

When using Cypress, you can generate code coverage report by running your dev server with instrumented code:

Build your Angular application with instrumented code:

    <%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> run webapp:instrumenter

Start your backend without compiling frontend:

    <%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> run backend:start

Start your Cypress end to end testing:

    <%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> run e2e:cypress:coverage

The coverage report is generated under `./coverage/lcov-report/`
