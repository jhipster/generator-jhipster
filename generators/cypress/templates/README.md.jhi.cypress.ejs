### E2E Webapp Code Coverage

When using Cypress, you can generate code coverage report by running your dev server with instrumented code:

Build your Angular application with instrumented code:

    npm run webapp:instrumenter

Start your backend without compiling frontend:

    npm run backend:start

Start your Cypress end to end testing:

    npm run e2e:cypress:coverage

The coverage report is generated under `./coverage/lcov-report/`
