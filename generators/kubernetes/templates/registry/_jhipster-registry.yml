# JHipster Registry HA cluster
#
# Note that as this is based on a StatefulSet, it will only work on Kubernetes >= 1.5
#
# By default, the JHipster Registry and its UI is not accessible from outside the cluster for security reasons
# You can setup temporary access to it on localhost:8761 by running :
#   kubectl port-forward jhipster-registry-0 8761
#
# To scale your JHipster Registry cluster :
#   In this file, change the value of spec.replicas and CLUSTER_SIZE to any value
#   Apply the descriptor again : `kubectl apply -f jhipster-registry.yml`
#   This will create new replicas with the correct CLUSTER_SIZE which is mandatory so that all Eureka server can connect directly to all the others.
#   Then delete the previous replica pods one by one so that they can be recreated with the correct CLUSTER_SIZE configuration.
#   `kubectl delete pod jhipster-registry-0`, `kubectl delete pod jhipster-registry-1`
