The build system will install automatically the recommended version of Node and <%- nodePackageManager %>.

We provide a wrapper to launch <%- nodePackageManager %>.
<%_ } else { _%>
Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Node is used to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
<%_ } _%>
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

```
<%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> install
```

We use <%- nodePackageManager %> scripts and <&- fragments.customCliSection(' ') &>[<%= clientBundlerName %>][] as our build system.

  <%_ if (cacheProviderRedis || cacheProviderHazelcast || cacheProviderMemcached) { _%>
If you are using <%= cacheProvider %> as a cache, you will have to launch a cache server.
To start your cache server, run:

```
docker compose -f src/main/docker/<%= cacheProviderHazelcast?'hazelcast-management-center':cacheProvider %>.yml up -d
```

    <%_ if (cacheProviderRedis) { _%>

The cache can also be turned off by adding to the application yaml:

```yaml
spring:
    cache:
        type: none
```

See [here](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/io/caching.html#io.caching.provider.none) for details.

**WARNING**: If you're using the second level Hibernate cache and disabling the Spring cache, you have to disable the second level Hibernate cache as well since they are using
the same CacheManager.
    <%_ } _%>
  <%_ } _%>

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

```
<%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> backend:start
<%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> start
```

<%= clientPackageMngrName %> is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `<%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> update` and `<%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `<%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> help update`.

The `<%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> run` command will list all the scripts available to run for this project.

### PWA Support

JHipster ships with PWA (Progressive Web App) support, and it's turned off by default. One of the main components of a PWA is a service worker.

  <%_ if (!clientFrameworkAngular) { _%>
The service worker initialization code is commented out by default. To enable it, uncomment the following code in `<%= clientSrcDir %>index.html`:

```html
<script>
    if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
        navigator.serviceWorker
        .register('./service-worker.js')
        .then(function() { console.log('Service Worker Registered'); });
    }
</script>
```

Note: [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) powers JHipster's service worker. It dynamically generates the `service-worker.js` file.
  <%_ } _%>
  <%_ if (clientFrameworkAngular) { _%>
The service worker initialization code is disabled by default. To enable it, uncomment the following code in `<%= clientSrcDir %>app/app.config.ts`:

```typescript
ServiceWorkerModule.register('ngsw-worker.js', { enabled: false }),
```
<%_ } _%>

### Managing dependencies

For example, to add [Leaflet][] library as a runtime dependency of your application, you would run the following command:

```
<%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> <%= clientPackageMngrAdd %> leaflet
```

To benefit from TypeScript type definitions from [DefinitelyTyped][] repository in development, you would run the following command:

```
<%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> <%= clientPackageMngrAddDev %> @types/leaflet
```

Then you would import the JS and CSS files specified in library's installation instructions so that [<%= clientBundlerName %>][] knows about them:
  <%_ if (clientFrameworkAngular) { _%>
Edit [<%= clientSrcDir %>app/app.config.ts](<%= clientSrcDir %>app/app.config.ts) file:

```
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.js';
```

Edit [<%= clientSrcDir %>content/scss/vendor.scss](<%= clientSrcDir %>content/scss/vendor.scss) file:

```
@import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';
```

  <%_ } _%>
Note: There are still a few other things remaining to do for Leaflet that we won't detail here.

For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].

<%_ if (microfrontend) { -%>
### Developing Microfrontend

Microservices doesn't contain every required backend feature to allow microfrontends to run alone.
You must start a pre-built gateway version or from source.

Start gateway from source:

```
cd gateway
<%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> run docker:db:up # start database if necessary
<%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> run docker:others:up # start service discovery and authentication service if necessary
<%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> run app:start # alias for ./(mvnw|gradlew)
```

Microfrontend's `build-watch` script is configured to watch and compile microfrontend's sources and synchronizes with gateway's frontend.
Start it using:

```
cd microfrontend
<%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> run docker:db:up # start database if necessary
<%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> run build-watch
```

It's possible to run microfrontend's frontend standalone using:

```
cd microfrontend
<%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> run docker:db:up # start database if necessary
<%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> watch # alias for `npm start` and `npm run backend:start` in parallel
```

<%_ } -%>

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [<%= clientTestFrameworkName %>][]. They're located near components and can be run with:

```
<%= nodePackageManagerCommand %> test
