### Using Angular CLI

You can also use [Angular CLI][] to generate some custom client code.

For example, the following command:

```
ng generate component my-component
```

will generate few files:

```
create <%= clientSrcDir %>app/my-component/my-component.component.html
create <%= clientSrcDir %>app/my-component/my-component.component.ts
update <%= clientSrcDir %>app/app.config.ts
```
