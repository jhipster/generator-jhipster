### JHipster Control Center

JHipster Control Center can help you manage and control your application(s). You can start a local control center server (accessible on http://localhost:7419) with:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/jhipster-control-center.yml up
```

<%_ if (authenticationTypeOauth2) { -%>
### OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect

Congratulations! You've selected an excellent way to secure your JHipster application. If you're not sure what OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC) are, please see [What the Heck is OAuth?](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/06/21/what-the-heck-is-oauth)

To log in to your app, you'll need to have [Keycloak](https://keycloak.org) up and running. The JHipster Team has created a Docker container for you that has the default users and roles. Start Keycloak using the following command.

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up
```

The security settings in `src/main/resources/config/application.yml` are configured for this image.

```yaml
spring:
  ...
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/jhipster
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: web_app
            client-secret: web_app
```

### Okta

If you'd like to use Okta instead of Keycloak, it's pretty quick using the [Okta CLI](https://cli.okta.com/). After you've installed it, run:

```shell
okta register
```

Then, in your JHipster app's directory, run `okta apps create` and select **JHipster**. This will set up an Okta app for you, create `ROLE_ADMIN` and `ROLE_USER` groups, create a `.okta.env` file with your Okta settings, and configure a `groups` claim in your ID token.

Run `source .okta.env` and start your app with Maven or Gradle. You should be able to sign in with the credentials you registered with.

If you're on Windows, you should install [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) so the `source` command will work.

If you'd like to configure things manually through the Okta developer console, see the instructions below.

First, you'll need to create a free developer account at <https://developer.okta.com/signup/>. After doing so, you'll get your own Okta domain, that has a name like `https://dev-123456.okta.com`.

Modify `src/main/resources/config/application.yml` to use your Okta settings.

```yaml
spring:
  ...
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          oidc:
            issuer-uri: https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default
        registration:
          oidc:
            client-id: {clientId}
            client-secret: {clientSecret}
security:
```

Create an OIDC App in Okta to get a `{clientId}` and `{clientSecret}`. To do this, log in to your Okta Developer account and navigate to **Applications** > **Add Application**. Click **Web** and click the **Next** button. Give the app a name you’ll remember, specify `http://localhost:8080` as a Base URI, and `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/oidc` as a Login Redirect URI. Click **Done**, then Edit and add `http://localhost:8080` as a Logout redirect URI. Copy and paste the client ID and secret into your `application.yml` file.

Create a `ROLE_ADMIN` and `ROLE_USER` group and add users into them. Modify e2e tests to use this account when running integration tests. You'll need to change credentials in `<%= CLIENT_TEST_SRC_DIR %>e2e/account/account.spec.ts` and `<%= CLIENT_TEST_SRC_DIR %>e2e/admin/administration.spec.ts`.

Navigate to **API** > **Authorization Servers**, click the **Authorization Servers** tab and edit the default one. Click the **Claims** tab and **Add Claim**. Name it "groups", and include it in the ID Token. Set the value type to "Groups" and set the filter to be a Regex of `.*`.

After making these changes, you should be good to go! If you have any issues, please post them to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jhipster). Make sure to tag your question with "jhipster" and "okta".

<%_ if (enableSwaggerCodegen) { _%>
### Doing API-First development using openapi-generator

[OpenAPI-Generator]() is configured for this application. You can generate API code from the `src/main/resources/swagger/api.yml` definition file by running:
    <%_ if (buildToolMaven) { _%>
```bash
./mvnw generate-sources
```
    <%_ } _%>
    <%_ if (buildToolGradle) { _%>
```bash
./gradlew openApiGenerate
```
    <%_ } _%>
Then implements the generated delegate classes with `@Service` classes.

To edit the `api.yml` definition file, you can use a tool such as [Swagger-Editor](). Start a local instance of the swagger-editor using docker by running: `docker-compose -f src/main/docker/swagger-editor.yml up -d`. The editor will then be reachable at [http://localhost:7742](http://localhost:7742).

Refer to [Doing API-First development][] for more details.

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar

To build the final jar and optimize the <%= baseName %> application for production, run:

```
<%_ if (buildToolMaven) { _%>
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify
<%_ } _%>
<%_ if (buildToolGradle) { _%>
./gradlew -Pprod clean bootJar
<%_ } _%>
```

<%_ if (!skipClient) { _%>
This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
<%_ } _%>
To ensure everything worked, run:

```
<%_ if (buildToolMaven) { _%>
java -jar target/*.jar
<%_ } _%>
<%_ if (buildToolGradle) { _%>
java -jar build/libs/*.jar
<%_ } _%>
```

<% if (!skipClient) { %>Then navigate to [http://localhost:<%= serverPort %>](http://localhost:<%= serverPort %>) in your browser.
<% } %>
Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

### Packaging as war

To package your application as a war in order to deploy it to an application server, run:

```
<%_ if (buildToolMaven) { _%>
./mvnw -Pprod,war clean verify
<%_ } _%>
<%_ if (buildToolGradle) { _%>
./gradlew -Pprod -Pwar clean bootWar
<%_ } _%>
```

<&- fragments.productionSection() &>
## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

```
<%_ if (buildToolMaven) { _%>
./mvnw verify
<%_ } else { _%>
./gradlew test integrationTest jacocoTestReport
<%_ } _%>
```

<&- fragments.testingSection() -&>
<%_ if (gatlingTests) { _%>
### Other tests

Performance tests are run by [Gatling][] and written in Scala. They're located in [src/test/gatling](src/test/gatling).

To use those tests, you must install Gatling from [https://gatling.io/](https://gatling.io/).
<%_ } _%>

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

<%_ if (cypressCoverage) { _%>

### E2E Webapp Code Coverage

When using Cypress, you can generate code coverage report by running your dev server with instrumented code:

Build your Angular application with instrumented code:

    npm run webapp:instrumenter

Start your backend without compiling frontend:

    npm run backend:start

Start your Cypress end to end testing:

    npm run e2e:cypress:coverage

The coverage report is generated under `./coverage/lcov-report/`

<%_ } _%>

### Code quality

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

Note: we have turned off authentication in [src/main/docker/sonar.yml](src/main/docker/sonar.yml) for out of the box experience while trying out SonarQube, for real use cases turn it back on.

You can run a Sonar analysis with using the [sonar-scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner)<% if (buildTool) { %> or by using the <% if (buildTool === 'maven') { %>maven<% } %><% if (buildTool === 'gradle') { %>gradle<% } %> plugin<% } %>.

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

<%_ if (buildToolMaven) { _%>
```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify sonar:sonar
```

If you need to re-run the Sonar phase, please be sure to specify at least the `initialize` phase since Sonar properties are loaded from the sonar-project.properties file.

```
./mvnw initialize sonar:sonar
```
<%_ } else if (buildToolGradle) { _%>
```
./gradlew -Pprod clean check jacocoTestReport sonarqube
```
<%_ } _%>

For more information, refer to the [Code quality page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

<%_ if (!databaseTypeNo) { _%>
For example, to start a <%= prodDatabaseType %> database in a docker container, run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/<%= prodDatabaseType %>.yml up -d
```

To stop it and remove the container, run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/<%= prodDatabaseType %>.yml down
```
<%_ } _%>

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

```
<% if (buildToolMaven) { %>./mvnw -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild<% } %><% if (buildToolGradle) { %>./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jibDockerBuild<% } %>
```

Then run:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d
```

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

## Continuous Integration (optional)

To configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (`jhipster ci-cd`), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page for more information.
