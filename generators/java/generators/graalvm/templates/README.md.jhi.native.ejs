### About Native Build

#### Installation

To build a Native image, you need to install a JDK that is compatible with GraalVM. Please refer to the [GraalVM Release Notes](https://www.graalvm.org/release-notes/) and install the appropriate JDK. Using SDKMAN simplifies the installation process.
```
sdk install java 21-graalce
```
#### How to Build a Native Image

To build a native image, execute the following command:
```bash
npm run native-package
# <%- packageJsonScripts['native-package'] %>
```

After that, set up peripheral services like PostgreSQL using `npm run services:up`(<%- packageJsonScripts['services:up'] %>) and ensure everything is ready.

Lastly, run the Native image and experience its fast startup ðŸ˜Š.
```bash
npm run native-start
# <%- packageJsonScripts['native-start'] %>
```

If you've enabled e2e testing with Cypress, you can verify its operation using the following command:
```bash
npm run native-e2e
# <%- packageJsonScripts['native-e2e'] %>
```
