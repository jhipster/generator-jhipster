### Doing API-First development using openapi-generator-cli

[OpenAPI-Generator]() is configured for this application. You can generate API code from the `src/main/resources/swagger/api.yml` definition file by running:
<%_ if (buildToolMaven) { _%>
```bash
./mvnw generate-sources
```
<%_ } _%>
<%_ if (buildToolGradle) { _%>
```bash
./gradlew openApiGenerate
```
<%_ } _%>
Then implements the generated delegate classes with `@Service` classes.

To edit the `api.yml` definition file, you can use a tool such as [Swagger-Editor](). Start a local instance of the swagger-editor using docker by running: `docker compose -f src/main/docker/swagger-editor.yml up -d`. The editor will then be reachable at [http://localhost:7742](http://localhost:7742).

Refer to [Doing API-First development][] for more details.
