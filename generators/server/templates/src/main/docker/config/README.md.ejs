# Central configuration sources details

<%_ if (serviceDiscoveryType === 'eureka') { _%>
The JHipster-Registry will use the following directories as its configuration source :
- localhost-config : when running the registry in docker with the jhipster-registry.yml docker-compose file
- docker-config : when running the registry and the app both in docker with the app.yml docker-compose file
<%_ } _%>
<%_ if (serviceDiscoveryType === 'consul') { _%>
When running the consul.yml or app.yml docker-compose files, files located in `central-server-config/`
will get automatically loaded in Consul's K/V store. Adding or editing files will trigger a reloading.
