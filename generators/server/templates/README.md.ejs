This application was generated using JHipster <%= jhipsterVersion %>, you can find documentation and help at [<%= DOCUMENTATION_ARCHIVE_URL %>](<%= DOCUMENTATION_ARCHIVE_URL %>).
<%_ if (applicationType === 'gateway' || applicationType === 'microservice' || applicationType === 'uaa') { _%>

This is a "<%= applicationType %>" application intended to be part of a microservice architecture, please refer to the [Doing microservices with JHipster][] page of the documentation for more information.
<% if (applicationType === 'uaa') { %>
This is also a JHipster User Account and Authentication (UAA) Server, refer to [Using UAA for Microservice Security][] for details on how to secure JHipster microservices with OAuth2.<% } %>
<%_ } _%>
<%_ if (applicationType === 'gateway' || applicationType === 'microservice' || applicationType === 'uaa') { _%>
This application is configured for Service Discovery and Configuration with <% if (serviceDiscoveryType === 'eureka') { %>the JHipster-Registry<% } %><% if (serviceDiscoveryType === 'consul') { %>Consul<% } %>. On launch, it will refuse to start if it is not able to connect to <% if (serviceDiscoveryType === 'eureka') { %>the JHipster-Registry at [http://localhost:8761](http://localhost:8761)<% } %><% if (serviceDiscoveryType === 'consul') { %>Consul at [http://localhost:8500](http://localhost:8500)<% } %>.<% if (serviceDiscoveryType === 'eureka') { %> For more information, read our documentation on [Service Discovery and Configuration with the JHipster-Registry][].<% } %><% if (serviceDiscoveryType === 'consul') { %> For more information, read our documentation on [Service Discovery and Configuration with Consul][].<% } %>
<%_ } _%>

## Development

<%_ if (skipClient) { _%>
To start your application in the dev profile, simply run:

    <% if (buildTool === 'maven') { %>./mvnw<% } %><% if (buildTool === 'gradle'){ %>./gradlew<% } %>

<%_ } _%>
<%_ if (!skipClient) { _%>
Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
<%_ if (clientPackageManager === 'yarn') { _%>
2. [Yarn][]: We use Yarn to manage Node dependencies.
   Depending on your system, you can install Yarn either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
<%_ } _%>

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    <%= clientPackageManager %> install

We use <%= clientPackageManager %> scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.
<% if (buildTool === 'maven') { %>
    ./mvnw<% } %><% if (buildTool === 'gradle') { %>
    ./gradlew<% } %>
    <%= clientPackageManager %> start

[<%= clientPackageMngrName %>][] is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `<%= clientPackageManager %> update` and `<%= clientPackageManager %> install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `<%= clientPackageManager %> help update`.

The `<%= clientPackageManager %> run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.
<%_ if (authenticationType === 'oauth2') { _%>

## OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect

Congratulations! You've selected an excellent way to secure your JHipster application. If you're not sure what OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC) are, please see [What the Heck is OAuth?](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/06/21/what-the-heck-is-oauth)

To log in to your app, you'll need to have [Keycloak](https://keycloak.org) up and running. The JHipster Team has created a Docker container for you that has the default users and roles. Start Keycloak using the following command.

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up
```

The security settings in `src/main/resources/application.yml` are configured for this image.

```yaml
security:
    basic:
        enabled: false
    oauth2:
        client:
            accessTokenUri: http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/jhipster/protocol/openid-connect/token
            userAuthorizationUri: http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/jhipster/protocol/openid-connect/auth
            clientId: web_app
            clientSecret: web_app
            scope: openid profile email
        resource:
            userInfoUri: http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/jhipster/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo
```

### Okta

If you'd like to use Okta instead of Keycloak, you'll need to change a few things. First, you'll need to create a free developer account at <https://developer.okta.com/signup/>. After doing so, you'll get your own Okta domain, that has a name like `https://dev-123456.oktapreview.com`.

Modify `src/main/resources/application.yml` to use your Okta settings.

```yaml
security:
    basic:
        enabled: false
    oauth2:
        client:
            accessTokenUri: https://{yourOktaDomain}.com/oauth2/default/v1/token
            userAuthorizationUri: https://{yourOktaDomain}.com/oauth2/default/v1/authorize
            clientId: {clientId}
            clientSecret: {clientSecret}
            scope: openid profile email
        resource:
            userInfoUri: https://{yourOktaDomain}.com/oauth2/default/v1/userinfo
```

Create an OIDC App in Okta to get a `{clientId}` and `{clientSecret}`. To do this, log in to your Okta Developer account and navigate to **Applications** > **Add Application**. Click **Web** and click the **Next** button. Give the app a name youâ€™ll remember, specify `http://localhost:8080` as a Base URI, and `http://localhost:8080/login` as a Login Redirect URI. Click **Done** and copy the client ID and secret into your `application.yml` file.

> **TIP:** If you want to use the [Ionic Module for JHipster](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-jhipster-ionic), you'll need to add `http://localhost:8100` as a **Login redirect URI** as well.

Create a `ROLE_ADMIN` and `ROLE_USER` group and add users into them. Create a user (e.g., "admin@jhipster.org" with password "Java is hip in 2017!"). Modify e2e tests to use this account when running integration tests. You'll need to change credentials in `src/test/javascript/e2e/account/account.spec.ts` and `src/test/javascript/e2e/admin/administration.spec.ts`.

Navigate to **API** > **Authorization Servers**, click the **Authorization Servers** tab and edit the default one. Click the **Claims** tab and **Add Claim**. Name it "groups" or "roles", and include it in the ID Token. Set the value type to "Groups" and set the filter to be a Regex of `.*`.

After making these changes, you should be good to go! If you have any issues, please post them to [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jhipster). Make sure to tag your question with "jhipster" and "okta".
<%_ } _%>

### Service workers

Service workers are commented by default, to enable them please uncomment the following code.

* The service worker registering script in index.html

```html
<script>
    if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
        navigator.serviceWorker
        .register('./sw.js')
        .then(function() { console.log('Service Worker Registered'); });
    }
</script>
```

Note: workbox creates the respective service worker and dynamically generate the `sw.js`

### Managing dependencies

For example, to add [Leaflet][] library as a runtime dependency of your application, you would run following command:

    <%= clientPackageManager %> <%= clientPackageMngrAdd %> leaflet

To benefit from TypeScript type definitions from [DefinitelyTyped][] repository in development, you would run following command:

    <%= clientPackageManager %> <%= clientPackageMngrAddDev %> @types/leaflet

Then you would import the JS and CSS files specified in library's installation instructions so that [Webpack][] knows about them:
<%_ if (clientFramework === 'angularX') { _%>
Edit [src/main/webapp/app/vendor.ts](src/main/webapp/app/vendor.ts) file:
~~~
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.js';
~~~

Edit [src/main/webapp/content/css/vendor.css](src/main/webapp/content/css/vendor.css) file:
~~~
@import '~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';
~~~
<%_ } _%>
Note: there are still few other things remaining to do for Leaflet that we won't detail here.
<%_ } _%>

For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].

<%_ if (clientFramework === 'angularX' && applicationType !== 'microservice') { _%>
### Using angular-cli

You can also use [Angular CLI][] to generate some custom client code.

For example, the following command:

    ng generate component my-component

will generate few files:

    create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.html
    create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.ts
    update src/main/webapp/app/app.module.ts
<%_ } _%>

<%_ if (enableSwaggerCodegen) { _%>
### Doing API-First development using openapi-generator

[OpenAPI-Generator]() is configured for this application. You can generate API code from the `src/main/resources/swagger/api.yml` definition file by running:
    <%_ if (buildTool === 'maven') { _%>
```bash
./mvnw generate-sources
```
    <%_ } _%>
    <%_ if (buildTool === 'gradle') { _%>
```bash
./gradlew openApiGenerate
```
    <%_ } _%>
Then implements the generated delegate classes with `@Service` classes.

To edit the `api.yml` definition file, you can use a tool such as [Swagger-Editor](). Start a local instance of the swagger-editor using docker by running: `docker-compose -f src/main/docker/swagger-editor.yml up -d`. The editor will then be reachable at [http://localhost:7742](http://localhost:7742).

Refer to [Doing API-First development][] for more details.
<%_ } _%>

## Building for production

To optimize the <%= baseName %> application for production, run:
<% if (buildTool === 'maven') { %>
    ./mvnw -Pprod clean package<% } %><% if (buildTool === 'gradle') { %>
    ./gradlew -Pprod clean bootWar<% } %>

<%_ if (!skipClient) { _%>
This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
<%_ } _%>
To ensure everything worked, run:
<% if (buildTool === 'maven') { %>
    java -jar target/*.war<% } %><% if (buildTool === 'gradle') { %>
    java -jar build/libs/*.war<% } %>

<% if (!skipClient) { %>Then navigate to [http://localhost:<%= serverPort %>](http://localhost:<%= serverPort %>) in your browser.
<% } %>
Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    <% if (buildTool === 'maven') { %>./mvnw clean test<% } else { %>./gradlew test<% } %>
<% if (!skipClient) { %>
### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Karma][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in [<%= CLIENT_TEST_SRC_DIR %>](<%= CLIENT_TEST_SRC_DIR %>) and can be run with:

    <%= clientPackageManager %> test

<% if (protractorTests) { %>UI end-to-end tests are powered by [Protractor][], which is built on top of WebDriverJS. They're located in [<%= CLIENT_TEST_SRC_DIR %>e2e](<%= CLIENT_TEST_SRC_DIR %>e2e)
and can be run by starting Spring Boot in one terminal (`<% if (buildTool === 'maven') { %>./mvnw spring-boot:run<% } else { %>./gradlew bootRun<% } %>`) and running the tests (`<%= clientPackageManager %> run e2e`) in a second one.<% } %>
<% } %><% if (gatlingTests) { %>### Other tests

Performance tests are run by [Gatling][] and written in Scala. They're located in [src/test/gatling](src/test/gatling).

To use those tests, you must install Gatling from [https://gatling.io/](https://gatling.io/).
<% } %>
For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.
<% if (databaseType !== 'no') { %>
For example, to start a <%= prodDatabaseType%> database in a docker container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/<%= prodDatabaseType%>.yml up -d

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/<%= prodDatabaseType%>.yml down
<% } %>
You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    <% if (buildTool === 'maven') { %>./mvnw verify -Pprod dockerfile:build dockerfile:tag@version dockerfile:tag@commit<% } %><% if (buildTool === 'gradle') { %>./gradlew bootWar -Pprod buildDocker<% } %>

Then run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

## Continuous Integration (optional)

To configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (`jhipster ci-cd`), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page for more information.
