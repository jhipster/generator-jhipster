This application was generated using JHipster <%= jhipsterVersion %>, you can find documentation and help at [<%= DOCUMENTATION_ARCHIVE_URL %>](<%= DOCUMENTATION_ARCHIVE_URL %>).
<%_ if (applicationType === 'gateway' || applicationType === 'microservice' || applicationType === 'uaa') { _%>

This is a "<%= applicationType %>" application intended to be part of a microservice architecture, please refer to the [Doing microservices with JHipster][] page of the documentation for more information.
<% if (applicationType === 'uaa') { %>
This is also a JHipster User Account and Authentication (UAA) Server, refer to [Using UAA for Microservice Security][] for details on how to secure JHipster microservices with OAuth2.<% } %>
<%_ } _%>
<%_ if (applicationType === 'gateway' || applicationType === 'microservice' || applicationType === 'uaa') { _%>
This application is configured for Service Discovery and Configuration with <% if (serviceDiscoveryType === 'eureka') { %>the JHipster-Registry<% } %><% if (serviceDiscoveryType === 'consul') { %>Consul<% } %>. On launch, it will refuse to start if it is not able to connect to <% if (serviceDiscoveryType === 'eureka') { %>the JHipster-Registry at [http://localhost:8761](http://localhost:8761)<% } %><% if (serviceDiscoveryType === 'consul') { %>Consul at [http://localhost:8500](http://localhost:8500)<% } %>.<% if (serviceDiscoveryType === 'eureka') { %> For more information, read our documentation on [Service Discovery and Configuration with the JHipster-Registry][].<% } %><% if (serviceDiscoveryType === 'consul') { %> For more information, read our documentation on [Service Discovery and Configuration with Consul][].<% } %>
<%_ } _%>

## Development

<%_ if(skipClient) { _%>
To start your application in the dev profile, simply run:

    <% if (buildTool == 'maven') { %>./mvnw<% } %><% if (buildTool == 'gradle'){ %>./gradlew<% } %>

<%_ } _%>
<%_ if(!skipClient) { _%>
Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
<%_ if (clientPackageManager === 'yarn') { _%>
2. [Yarn][]: We use Yarn to manage Node dependencies.
   Depending on your system, you can install Yarn either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
<%_ } _%>

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    <%= clientPackageManager %> install

<%_ if (clientFramework !== 'angular1') { _%>
We use <%= clientPackageManager %> scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.

<%_ } else { _%>
We use [Gulp][] as our build system. Install the Gulp command-line tool globally with:

    <%= clientPackageManager %> <%= clientPackageMngrAddGlobal %> gulp-cli
<%_ } _%>

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.
<% if (buildTool == 'maven') { %>
    ./mvnw<% } %><% if (buildTool == 'gradle') { %>
    ./gradlew<% } %>
<%_ if (clientFramework !== 'angular1') { _%>
    <%= clientPackageManager %> start

[<%= clientPackageMngrName %>][] is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `<%= clientPackageManager %> update` and `<%= clientPackageManager %> install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `<%= clientPackageManager %> help update`.

The `<%= clientPackageManager %> run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.

### Managing dependencies

For example, to add [Leaflet][] library as a runtime dependency of your application, you would run following command:

    <%= clientPackageManager %> <%= clientPackageMngrAdd %> leaflet

To benefit from TypeScript type definitions from [DefinitelyTyped][] repository in development, you would run following command:

    <%= clientPackageManager %> <%= clientPackageMngrAddDev %> @types/leaflet

Then you would import the JS and CSS files specified in library's installation instructions so that [Webpack][] knows about them:

Edit [src/main/webapp/app/vendor.ts](src/main/webapp/app/vendor.ts) file:
~~~
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.js';
~~~

Edit [src/main/webapp/content/css/vendor.css](src/main/webapp/content/css/vendor.css) file:
~~~
@import '~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';
~~~

Note: there are still few other things remaining to do for Leaflet that we won't detail here.
<%_ } else { _%>
    gulp

[Bower][] is used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [bower.json](bower.json). You can also run `bower update` and `bower install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `-h` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `bower update -h`.
<%_ } _%>
<%_ } _%>

For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].

<%_ if (clientFramework !== 'angular1') { _%>
### Using angular-cli

You can also use [Angular CLI][] to generate some custom client code.

For example, the following command:

    ng generate component my-component

will generate few files:

    create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.html
    create src/main/webapp/app/my-component/my-component.component.ts
    update src/main/webapp/app/app.module.ts
<%_ } _%>

## Building for production

To optimize the <%= baseName %> application for production, run:
<% if (buildTool == 'maven') { %>
    ./mvnw -Pprod clean package<% } %><% if (buildTool == 'gradle') { %>
    ./gradlew -Pprod clean bootRepackage<% } %>

<%_ if(!skipClient) { _%>
This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
<%_ } _%>
To ensure everything worked, run:
<% if (buildTool == 'maven') { %>
    java -jar target/*.war<% } %><% if (buildTool == 'gradle') { %>
    java -jar build/libs/*.war<% } %>

<% if(!skipClient) { %>Then navigate to [http://localhost:<%= serverPort %>](http://localhost:<%= serverPort %>) in your browser.
<% } %>
Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    <% if (buildTool == 'maven') { %>./mvnw clean test<% } else { %>./gradlew test<% } %>
<% if(!skipClient) { %>
### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Karma][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in [<%= CLIENT_TEST_SRC_DIR %>](<%= CLIENT_TEST_SRC_DIR %>) and can be run with:

<%_ if (clientFramework !== 'angular1') { _%>
    <%= clientPackageManager %> test
<%_ } else { _%>
    gulp test
<%_ } _%>

<% if (protractorTests) { %>UI end-to-end tests are powered by [Protractor][], which is built on top of WebDriverJS. They're located in [<%= CLIENT_TEST_SRC_DIR %>e2e](<%= CLIENT_TEST_SRC_DIR %>e2e)
and can be run by starting Spring Boot in one terminal (`<% if (buildTool == 'maven') { %>./mvnw spring-boot:run<% } else { %>./gradlew bootRun<% } %>`) and running the tests (`<% if (clientFramework !== 'angular1') { %><%= clientPackageManager %> run e2e<% } else { %>gulp itest<% } %>`) in a second one.<% } %>
<% } %><% if (gatlingTests) { %>### Other tests

Performance tests are run by [Gatling][] and written in Scala. They're located in [src/test/gatling](src/test/gatling) and can be run with:

    <% if (buildTool == 'maven') { %>./mvnw gatling:execute<% } else { %>./gradlew gatlingRun<% } %>
<% } %>
For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.
For example, to start a <%= prodDatabaseType%> database in a docker container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/<%= prodDatabaseType%>.yml up -d

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/<%= prodDatabaseType%>.yml down

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    <% if (buildTool == 'maven') { %>./mvnw package -Pprod docker:build<% } %><% if (buildTool == 'gradle') { %>./gradlew bootRepackage -Pprod buildDocker<% } %>

Then run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

## Continuous Integration (optional)

To configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (`jhipster ci-cd`), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page for more information.
