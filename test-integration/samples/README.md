# Sample application generation

To generate test applications, either automatically by Travis or locally on the developper machine, a number of pre-defined configuratiosn have been prepared.

## Application configurations

 Those are described in `.yo-rc.json` files which is the descriptor file created by Yeoman to keep track of the choices selected while generating an application.
